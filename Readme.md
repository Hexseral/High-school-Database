Welcome to my repository. 
I will be demonstrating my skills that I have learned during my time taking Programming II (COP 3003) at Florida Gulf Coast University.
I will also be preparing for interviews at the same time by completing problems from the book "Cracking The Coding Interview"
Check my project milestones to see my goals to hit with each problem I complete.
