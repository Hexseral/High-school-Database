Welcome to my Ecosystem Simulation. 
I will be demonstrating my skills that I have learned during my time taking Programming II (COP 3003) at Florida Gulf Coast University.

This program is meant to be a simulated environment using unity to build an ecosystem that allows us to simulate population in a predetor pray environment.
